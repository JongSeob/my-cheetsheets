# **value is captured in pre-poned region**

Because of this reason, data capturing timing match the reg inside alwyas block.

# $rose, $fell, and $stable is synchronous with clock

It also makes to synchronize with caturing operation of the reg inside alwyas block.

# Use system functions

System functions provided by System Verilog such as $onehot, $countbits, $isunknown, and $countones help us to make the code concise.
